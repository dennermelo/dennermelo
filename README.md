## Hello there

I don't know how you ended up here, but I promise my repositories are tidy. ðŸ˜™

## Public information

My name is Denner Melo. I currently live in SÃ£o Leopoldo, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil and I am currently in the Brazilian Army.

On my free time I try to learn new things, develop some projects and try to keep my mind always thinking. But lately having free time is kind of complicated, because the Army needs many hours of work.

My current focus is the development of my portfolio, creating some simple projects that add something to my experience.
